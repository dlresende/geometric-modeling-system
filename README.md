# Geometric Modeling System

The geometric modeling system kata was inspired from professor Jon Pearce's notes on [The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~pearce/cs251b/principles/ocp.htm).

This kata will help you to understand the Open-Closed Principle.

## What to do

Try to add the new shape Square without modifying any other component of the application.

## Hints

In the current state, to every new shape we want to add, we need to modify existing classes in the system. Nevertheless, the Open-Closed principle says that applications should be open for extension but closed for modification. In order to satisfy OCP, we need to redesign our application.
